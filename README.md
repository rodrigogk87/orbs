ERC721 Smart contract

This is an alpha version of a project where the user can generate a random piano song, then some random elements to generate that song are hashed and the last 6 hexadecimal digits of the last 5 elements are used to generate an animation on a canvas using three.js If minted it generates metadata to reconstruct both the song and the animation and that metadata is stored in the blockchain as an NFT.
