ERC721 Smart contract

This is an alpha version of a project where the user can generate a random piano song, then some random elements to generate that song are hashed and the last 6 hexadecimal digits of the last 5 elements are used to generate the colors of an animation on a canvas, both the song and the animation are recorded using the MediaRecorder API. When the recording finishes its uploaded to ipfs and prompt the user to pay to mint the creation, if the user pays, the link of ipfs is stored on a erc721 smart contract proving the user ownership of the nft.
